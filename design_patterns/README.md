# Summary

## SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsability Principle

- A class should onbly have one reason to change
- Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

### Open-Closed Principle

- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle

- You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

### Interface Segregation Principle

- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You ain't going to need it

### Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
