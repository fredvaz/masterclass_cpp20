The C++20 Masterclass Section 41: Polymorphism

General Notes:
    One of the key features of class inheritance is that a pointer to a derived class is type-compatible
    with a pointer to its base class. Polymorphism is the art of taking advantage of this simple but
    powerful and versatile feature.

    *Polymorphism: a base pointer or reference managing derived class objects

    *Why we need polymorphism? To scale: for example, if we have 100 shapes in our program to draw
    *we will need to implement those 100 methods.

            *EXAMPLE: Quiz 76
            The overload with a std::string_view parameter is being eclipsed by
            the no param override in Two. But we're trying to go through a base pointer to call the method.
            The compiler will try its best and use polymorphism as a last resort. It will find a candidate
            at the One level and use that to print the best it can. The One::print(std::string_view) method
            only knows how to print the m_1 member and the color. Hence the output here.
